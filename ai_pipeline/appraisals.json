      "reason": "According to the parish bulletin, Confessions are heard for half an hour before all Masses (or by appointment), not only 12:35–13:05 Monday and Wednesday–Friday. They therefore take place before every scheduled Mass, including the Saturday Vigil and Sunday Masses, and also before the Monday 6:30 pm Mass. There is no public Mass on Tuesday, so no scheduled Confessions that day."
