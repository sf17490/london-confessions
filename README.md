## Notes by Sean:

TODO:

1. Correct the db schema to have address as a string DONE
2. Input data into the db directly using the online ui DONE
3. Input data into the db using the command line tool (the cmd line tool may be easier to hook up to an ai python script)
4. Set up website to fetch the data from the db DONE
5. Set up website to fetch the data from the db once/week instead of on every page load (there's no need to fetch on every page load). This might be over-optimising though.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
